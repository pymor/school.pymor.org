      <h1>Model Order Reduction</h1>

      <p>
          The numerical simulation of mathematical models described by partial differential
          equations (PDEs) or large systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is nowadays an
	  important tool for research in almost every scientific discipline. Yet, the use of such
	  models is often limited by the available computational resources.
      </p>

      <p>
          Over the last decade, a variety of algorithms have been developed which compute, for a
          given numerical ODE/PDE model, a mathematically certified surrogate that can be simulated in a
          small fraction of the time required for the solution of the original model. These
          techniques, known as model order reduction (MOR), are now becoming an integral part in
          many simulation workflows which otherwise would be infeasible, even on the largest
          available supercomputers.

        <h1>pyMOR</h1>
        <p>
            <a href="https://pymor.org">pyMOR</a> is a free software library for
            building model order reduction applications with the Python
            programming language. Implemented algorithms include reduced basis
            methods as well as system-theoretic methods. Some of the available
            methods are:
        </p>
        <ul>
	    <li>Greedy basis generation,</li>
            <li>Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD),</li>
            <li>Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM),</li>
            <li>POD-Greedy,</li>
            <li>Balanced Truncation,</li>
            <li>Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm (IRKA),
	    <li>models based on artificial neural networks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
 	    All algorithms in pyMOR are formulated in terms of abstract interfaces for seamless
	    integration with external PDE solver packages.
	    Currently, there is support for <a href="https://dealii.org">deal.II</a>,
  	    <a href="https://dune-project.org">DUNE</a>, <a href="http://fenicsproject.org">FEniCS</a>, 
	    and <a href="https://ngsolve.org">NGSolve</a>. Custom (domain specific) solvers can be
            easily integrated with pyMOR.
	    Moreover, pure Python implementations of FEM (Finite Element Method) and FVM
	    (Finite Volume Method) discretizations using the
	    <a href="https://scipy.org/">NumPy/SciPy</a> scientific computing 
  	    stack are provided for getting started quickly.

    <section id="school" class="black-frame about about-container about-container-bottom">
      <h1>pyMOR School</h1>
      <p>
          The pyMOR School is the third event for current and future pyMOR users and developers. It will take
	place at the <a href="/venue.html">Seminarraumzentrum WWU Münster</a> from Monday noon (October 4th) to Friday noon (October 8th).
      </p>

      <p>
          The School will consist of introductory lectures on the MOR methods available in pyMOR
	  combined with interactive pyMOR tutorial and exercise sessions. Further,
          participants are encouraged to bring their own projects to work on during the school
          with the support of the pyMOR developers.
      </p>

      <h1>Covid-19 Measures (subject to change)</h1>
      <p>
        We are trying our best to ensure everybody can safely attend the event. Following federal state, city
        and university rules is ensured in all activities.
        The number of in-person participants is limited to 35, which will be distributed across multiple rooms
        to allow ample spacing between participants.
        As a contact tracing measure, seating plans will be kept. The full list of measures is
        available <a href="{{ 'static/mathematics_muenster_hygienekonzept.pdf' | relative_url}}" alt="Hygienekonzept PDF">here</a>.
      </p><p>
        For people who can only join virtually
        the lectures will be live-streamed, with questions through a live chat.
        Participation in the coding/exercise sessions, will only be possible in person however.
