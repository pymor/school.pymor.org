      <h1>Model Order Reduction</h1>

      <p>
          The numerical simulation of mathematical models described by partial differential
          equations (PDEs) is nowadays an important tool for research in almost every scientific
          discipline. Yet, the use of such models is often limited by the available computational
          resources.
      </p>

      <p>
          Over the last decade, a variety of algorithms have been developed which compute, for a
          given numerical PDE model, a mathematically certified surrogate that can be simulated in a
          small fraction of the time required for the solution of the original model. These
          techniques, known as model order reduction (MOR), are now becoming an integral part in
          many simulation workflows which otherwise would be infeasible, even on the largest
          available supercomputers.

        <h1>pyMOR</h1>
        <p>
            <a href="https://pymor.org">pyMOR</a> is a free software library for
            building model order reduction applications with the Python
            programming language. Implemented algorithms include reduced basis
            methods as well as system-theoretic methods. Some of the available
            methods are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>proper orthogonal decomposition (POD),</li>
            <li>discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM),</li>
            <li>POD-Greedy,</li>
            <li>balanced truncation,</li>
            <li>iterative rational Krylov algorithm (IRKA).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            With pyMOR, it is possible to link to partial differential equations
            (PDE) solver packages. Currently, there is support for deal.II,
            DUNE, FEniCS, and NGSolve. Custom (domain specific) solvers can be
            easily integrated with pyMOR.

      <h1>pyMOR School</h1>
      <p>
          The pyMOR School is the third event for current and future pyMOR users. It will take
          place at the Seminarraumzentrum WWU MÃ¼nster from Monday noon (October 4th) to Friday noon (October 8th).
      </p>

      <p>
          The School will consist of introductory lectures on MOR methods available in pyMOR and
          programming sessions where participants will be able to use pyMOR for their own projects
          with the help of pyMOR developers.
      </p>

      <h1>Covid-19 Measures (subject to change)</h1>
      <p>
        We are trying our best to ensure everybody can safely attend the event. Following federal state, city
        and university rules is ensured in all activities.
        The number of in-person participants is limited to 35, which will be distributed across multiple rooms
        to allow ample spacing between participants.
        As a contact tracing measure, seating plans will be kept. The full list of measures is
        available <a href="{{ 'static/mathematics_muenster_hygienekonzept.pdf' | relative_url}}" alt="Hygienekonzept PDF">here</a>.
      </p><p>
        For people who can only join virtually
        the lectures will be live-streamed, with questions through a live chat.
        Participation in the hands on sessions, meaning tutorials and help from pyMOR developers with
        your own code, will only be possible in person however.
      </p>
