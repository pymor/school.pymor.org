      <h1>Model Order Reduction</h1>

      <p>
          The numerical simulation of mathematical models described by partial differential
          equations (PDEs) is nowadays an important tool for research in almost every scientific
          discipline. Yet, the use of such models is often limited by the available computational
          resources.
      </p>

      <p>
          Over the last decade, a variety of algorithms have been developed which compute, for a
          given numerical PDE model, a mathematically certified surrogate that can be simulated in a
          small fraction of the time required for the solution of the original model. These
          techniques, known as model order reduction (MOR), are now becoming an integral part in
          many simulation workflows which otherwise would be infeasible, even on the largest
          available supercomputers.

        <h1>pyMOR</h1>
        <p>
            <a href="https://pymor.org">pyMOR</a> is a free software library for
            building model order reduction applications with the Python
            programming language. Implemented algorithms include reduced basis
            methods as well as system-theoretic methods. Some of the available
            methods are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>proper orthogonal decomposition (POD),</li>
            <li>discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM),</li>
            <li>POD-Greedy,</li>
            <li>balanced truncation,</li>
            <li>iterative rational Krylov algorithm (IRKA).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            With pyMOR, it is possible to link to partial differential equations
            (PDE) solver packages. Currently, there is support for deal.II,
            DUNE, FEniCS, and NGSolve. Custom (domain specific) solvers can be
            easily integrated with pyMOR.

      <h1>pyMOR Online Course</h1>
      <p>
          The pyMOR Online Course is our replacement for this year's pyMOR School. 
          We hope to reach current and future pyMOR users. It will take
          place online from Monday (September 28th) to Friday (October 2nd) (exact schedule tbd.).
      </p>

      <p>
          The Course will consist of introductory lectures on MOR methods available in pyMOR and
          programming exercises where participants will learn to use pyMOR
          with the help of pyMOR developers.
