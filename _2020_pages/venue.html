      <h3>By public transport</h3>
        <p>Münster is well connected by train and bus. See the website of

            for more travel details.
        </p>
        <h4>From the train station to Seminarraumzentrum</h4>
          <p>Several bus lines lead from Münster railway station to the department building. It is best to take the
            bus lines 5, 11, 12, 22 in the direction of Gievenbeck or Nienberge. Get off at bus stop
            "<strong>Coesfelder Kreuz</strong>" after about 15 minutes.</p>
          <p>To get to the Seminarraumzentrum, cross the street with traffic lights. Make a left right after the
            crossing, walk straight till you turn right onto a parking lot. The entrace is on the far side of the
            building.
          <p>As an alternative, take a taxi from the main station to the  Seminarraumzentrum at "Orléans-Ring 12".</p>

      <h3>By car</h3>
      <p><strong>Coming from the south</strong>, take the motorway A1 or A43 north. If on  A1,  change to A43 at the
        motorway interchange Münster South, direction   Münster. When the motorway ends by the traffic lights go ahead
        for   another 500 meters, then turn left following the signs to   "Universitätsklinik" (university hospital).
        Follow this road over a   bridge and several traffic lights. At the crossing where the road signs   leading to
        the hospital point left, go straight ahead (there should be a   big concrete car park to your left) - the
         Seminarraumzentrum is now already on   your right side, take the entrance to the Seminarraumzentrum's parking
         after   about 20 meters. Attention - this can be easily overlooked! If so just   U-turn twice.</p>
      <p><strong>From North:</strong> Take A1 direction South. At exit Münster North,  leave  A1, direction Münster.
        You are now on B54 heading Münster, follow   instructions from West below.</p>
      <p><strong>From West (Netherlands)</strong>: If you want to avoid taking the  northern  motorways, take the B54
         into Münster (from Enschede). Pass the  motorway  entrance and drive right into town. At the first major
         crossing  with  traffic lights in Münster there is a sign to "Coesfeld", pointing   right. Follow it. At the
         second traffic light, there is a parking block   on your right. Take an U-Turn and go right after 20 meters
         into the   entrance of the Seminarraumzentrum.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The <strong>parking space</strong> of the department is reserved for members  of the   WWU. Respect the
         parking signs and recall that in Münster cars  are   towed rigorously. If you stay longer we advise you to
         take the free    parking deck over the road.</p>
      <p>If you would like to travel by car into the city you need to have a certified vehicle with a
         <a href="https://urbanaccessregulations.eu/countries-mainmenu-147/germany-mainmenu-61/munster"
          class="ext" target="_blank"><strong>emission sticker</strong></a>. The penalty for driving in a low emission
          zone in Germany without the sticker required is 80 € plus an administrative fee. Buy stickers only from the
           official city or TÜV websites. Other websites are often much more expensive, if they provide you with a
           valid sticker at all.</p>
